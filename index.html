    <h3>Intro: Lupe Fiasco</h3>
<p>
    Yeah, just a little bit<br>
    Just a little bit<br>
    And it goes...<br>
</p>
        <section>
    <h3> Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco</h3>
        </section>
<p>
        Lifestyles of the rich and famous<br>
        Bought a big house and a whole lot of Ranges<br>
        A fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers<br>
        A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers<br>
        And, some Mexican floral arrangers<br>
        A great big TV that'll entertain us<br>
        Some colorful commissions from some high-paid painters<br>
        Someone to take the rap so that I stay stainless<br>
        And, a new relationship with a banker<br>
        And two pinky rings for my manicured fingers<br>
        A trained German Shepherd that bark when it's angered<br>
        To watch my possessions and look out for strangers<br>
        And, a fifty-foot yacht with an anchor<br>
        A young supermodel that shall remain nameless<br>
        Ups and the downs, the sames and the changes<br>
        All the money in the world don't make it painless, no<br>
</p>

    <h3>Chorus: Lupe Fiasco</h3>
     <section>
    <p> 
        But they love it, and they love it, the more<br>
        The more you try to erase me<br>
        And they love it, and they love it<br>
        The more, the more<br>
        And they love it, and they love it, the more<br>
        The more that I appear, oh<br>
        Ugh, and they love it, and they love it<br>
        The more, the more<br>
        And they love it and they love it the more<br>
        The more you try the eraser<br>
        And they love it and they love it<br>
        The more, the more<br>
        And they love it and they love it the more<br>
        The more that you appear<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Verse 2: Kanye West</h3>
<p>
        Plain Pat, what up?<br>
        Ugh, ugh, lifestyles of the broke and famous<br>
        Let you know how crazy this game is<br>
        Look at all the new, beautiful faces<br>
        At home, supermodel MySpaces<br>
        Long for they shot on the TV screens<br>
        American Idol never seen these dreams<br>
        Just last week, they want to see ID<br>
        Now, they got you in V.I.P., huh?<br>
        How many people almost famous?<br>
        You almost remember what they name is<br>
        Like "Hey, didn't you play in?... no, it couldn't be, quit playin'"<br>
        And tryna keep that balance after MTV<br>
        That's a Real World Challenge<br>
        Back on that train<br>
        Never to be heard from again<br>

    
</p>
    <h3>Chorus: Lupe Fiasco</h3>
<p>     
        But they love it, and they love it, the more<br>
        The more you try to erase me<br>
        And they love it, and they love it<br>
        The more, the more<br>
        And they love it, and they love it, the more<br>
        The more that I appear, oh<br>
        Ugh, and they love it, and they love it<br>
        The more, the more<br>
        And they love it and they love it the more<br>
        The more you try the eraser<br>
        And they love it and they love it<br>
        The more, the more<br>
        And they love it and they love it the more<br>
        The more that you appear<br>

    <h3>Verse 3: Pharrell Williams</h3>
<p>      
         G-R-I-P, P-I-M-P
        I, any spelling, snitch, come on, that's me<br>
        I bring a burning sensation to the urban eye<br>
        Like an eye-drop of turpentine<br>
        You can listen to the serpent, fine<br>
        But the earth got gas; once it burps, it's fine<br>
        Some around me, they talk about degrees<br>
        Not GHG, how to cook a quarter key (Ugh)<br>
        Talking all nasal, he ain't over that cold<br>
        No glove, scrub, man, he just over that stove<br>
        Perfect paradigm, wrong place, wrong time<br>
        Should have been Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline<br>
        Number one chemist, look at him, no blemish<br>
        Eggshell off-white like a DuPont finish<br>
        Young, dumb, high-strung, who could handle us?<br>
        I wonder how God's gon' paint todays canvases<br>
        'Cause who knew that day that man would just<br>
        Go to V.A. with a Tec and spray campuses?<br>
        What a way to see the cover of Time<br>
        I know that ninja wish he was standing in line<br> 
</p>
    <h3>Chorus: Lupe Fiasco, Thom Yorke, & Pharell Williams</h3>

<p>      
        But they love it, and they love it, the more (To see it)<br>
         
        The more you try to erase me (As if he didn't do it)<br> 
        And they love it, and they love it<br> 
        The more, the more<br> 
        And they love it, and they love it, the more<br> 
        The more that I appear, oh<br> 
        Ugh, and they love it, and they love it<br> 
        The more, the more<br> 
        And they love it and they love it the more<br> 
        The more you try the eraser<br> 
        And they love it and they love it<br> 
        The more, the more<br> 
        And they love it and they love it the more<br> 
        The more that you appear <br>
